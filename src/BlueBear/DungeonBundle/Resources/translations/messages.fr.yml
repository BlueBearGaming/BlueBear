bluebear.dungeon.dwarf: Dwarf
bluebear.dungeon.dwarf.description: |
    These short and stocky defenders of mountain fortresses are often seen as stern and humorless.
    Known for mining the earth's treasures and crafting magnificent items from ore and gemstones,
    they have an unrivaled affinity for the bounties of the deep earth.
    Dwarves also have a tendency toward traditionalism and isolation that sometimes manifests as xenophobia.

bluebear.dungeon.elf: Elf
bluebear.dungeon.elf.description: |
    Tall, noble, and often haughty, elves are long-lived and subtle masters of the wilderness. Elves excel in the arcane
     arts. Often they use their intrinsic link to nature to forge new spells and create wondrous items that, like their
     creators, seem nearly impervious to the ravages of time. A private and often introverted race, elves can give the
     impression they are indifferent to the plights of others.

bluebear.dungeon.gnome: Gnome
bluebear.dungeon.gnome.description: |
    Expatriates of the strange land of fey, these small folk have a reputation for flighty and eccentric behavior. Many
    gnomes are whimsical artisans and tinkers, creating strange devices powered by magic, alchemy, and their quirky
    imagination. Gnomes have an insatiable need for new experiences that often gets them in trouble.

bluebear.dungeon.barbarian: Barbarian
bluebear.dungeon.barbarian.description: |
    For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle,
    conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not
    soldiers or professional warriors—they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as
    barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the
    moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death.
    They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail.
    These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing
    such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe
    to those who face their rage.

    Role: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far
    superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians
    charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.

    Alignment: Any nonlawful.

    Hit Die: d12.

bluebear.dungeon.monk: Monk
bluebear.dungeon.monk.description: |
    For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield—it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind.
    These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just
     as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies
     and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to
     self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover
     within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.

    Role: Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it's least expected, and taking
    advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with
    ease, aiding allies wherever they are needed most.

    Alignment: Any lawful.

    Hit Die: d8.

bluebear.dungeon.sorcerer: Sorcerer
bluebear.dungeon.sorcerer.description: |
    Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or
    simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals
    can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls
    endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and
    coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and
    inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities
    through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic,
    letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other
    spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life
    itself.

    Role: Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As
    they become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of spells, sorcerers often discover new and versatile
    ways of making use of magics other spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also grant them additional
    abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers are ever quite alike.

    Alignment: Any.

    Hit Die: d6.


bluebear.dungeon.dwarf.long_description: |
    Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined
    to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a
    reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. It could be said that their history shapes the dark
    disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at
    war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors.

    Dwarves are lovers of history and tradition, and their long lifespan leads to far less in the way of generational
    shifts in attitudes, styles, fashions, and trends than shorter-lived races exhibit. If a thing is not broken,
    they do not fix it or change it; and if it is broken, they fix it rather than replace it. Thrifty as a rule,
    dwarves are loath to discard anything unless it is truly ruined and unable to be fixed. At the same time, dwarves'
    meticulous, near-obsessive attention to detail and durability in their craftsmanship makes that a rare occurrence,
    as the things they make are built to last. As a result, buildings, artwork, tools, housewares, garments, weapons,
    and virtually everything else made by dwarves still sees regular use at an age when such items would be relegated
    to museum pieces, dusty antique shelves, or junkyard fodder by other races. Taken together, these traits create the
    impression that dwarves are a race frozen in time.

    Nothing could be further from the truth, however, as dwarves are both thoughtful and imaginative, willing to
    experiment, if always keen to refine and perfect a new technique or product before moving on to the next one.
    Dwarves have achieved feats of metallurgy, stonework, and engineering that have consistently outpaced the
    technological advances of other races, though some non-dwarven races have used magic to supplement and perfect their
    own creations to achieve the same ends through mystical rather than mundane means. They are also a race typified by
    stubborn courage and dedication to seeing tasks through to completion, whatever the risks. These traits have led dwarves
    to explore and settle in extreme environments that would cause other races to quail and retreat. From the darkest
    depths of the underworld to the highest mountain peaks, from rusting iron citadels along desolate rocky coasts to
    squat jungle ziggurats, dwarves have established their enclaves and redoubts, holding them against all comers or
    perishing to the last and leaving only their enduring monuments to stand as their legacy.

    While it is said that dwarves are not venturesome or inventive, it would be more accurate to say that they maintain
    a focus on and dedication to each task they undertake and every change they adopt, vetting such changes thoroughly
    before adopting them wholeheartedly. When faced with new circumstances and new needs, they react by applying tried
    and true tools and techniques systematically, using existing methods whenever possible rather than trying to invent
    novel solutions for every situation. If necessity requires, however, they throw themselves with equal vigor into
    developing the next perfect procedure for demolishing the obstacles that get in their way. Once their desired goal
    is obtained, they focus on consolidating each new piece of territory or conceptual advance. Dwarves thus rarely
    overextend themselves, but they also may miss opportunities to seize the initiative and maximize the advantages
    they create.

    Physical Description: Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with
    wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long
    length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids.
    Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse—no one familiar with their race trusts a
    beardless dwarven man.

    Society: The great distances between dwarves' mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that
    exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of
    stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of
    giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or
    unheard of, dwarves' fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to
    find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned
    long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to
    enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not
    hesitate to adopt what they call "aggressive negotiations."

    Relations: Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a history of violence as old as
    both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and halflings to be too frail,
    flighty, or "pretty" to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for
    humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.

    Alignment and Religion: Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish,
    they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work
    hard, they play even harder—especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good.

    Adventurers: Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the
    world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which
    to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies.
    Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward
    classes such as fighters and barbarians.

bluebear.dungeon.elf.long_description: |
    The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, though
    with key differences. While fey are truly linked to the flora and fauna of their homes, existing as the nearly
    immortal voices and guardians of the wilderness, elves are instead mortals who are in tune with the natural world
    around them. Elves seek to live in balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals. Some of
    this understanding is mystical, but an equal part comes from the elves' long lifespans, which in turn gives them
    long-ranging outlooks. Elves can expect to remain active in the same locale for centuries. By necessity, they must
    learn to maintain sustainable lifestyles, and this is most easily done when they work with nature, rather than
    attempting to bend it to their will.

    However, their links to nature are not entirely driven by pragmatism. Elves' bodies slowly change over time, taking
    on a physical representation of their mental and spiritual states, and those who dwell in a region for a long period
    of time find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration that
    reflects the local environment.

    Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends at both the personal and
    national levels, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, the resulting alliances can last for generations. Elves
    take great joy in forging alliances with races that share or exceed their long lifetimes, and often work to befriend
    dragons, outsiders, and fey. Those elves who spend their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand,
    often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of
    companions age and die before their eyes.

    Physical Description: Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated
    by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf
    can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored
    pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of human populations.
    However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite
    similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin
    tones.

    While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedeck
    themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion
    trendsetters.

    Society: Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Although, like
    most, elves prefer bountiful lands where resources are plentiful, when driven to live in harsher climates, they work
     hard to protect and shepherd the region's bounty, and learn how to maximize the benefit they receive from what
     little can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take
     pride as a society in the accomplishment. While this can make them excellent guides to outsiders they befriend who
     must travel through such lands, their disdain of those who have not learned to live off the scant land as they have
      makes such friends rare.

    Elves have an innate gift for craftsmanship and artistry, especially when working in wood, bone, ivory, or leather.
    Most, however, find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer to avoid forging, stonework, and pottery.
    When such work must be done within a community, a few elves may find themselves drawn to it, but regardless of their
    craftsmanship, such "dirt-wrights" are generally seen by other elves as being a bit off. In the most insular of
    elven societies, they may even be treated as lower class.

    Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and painstaking research. Their naturally keen minds
    and senses, combined with their inborn patience, make them particularly suited to wizardry. Arcane research and
    accomplishment are seen as both practical goals, in line with being a soldier or architect, and artistic endeavors
    as great as poetry or sculpture. Within elven society, wizards are held in extremely high regard as masters of an
    art both powerful and aesthetically valued. Other spellcasters are not disdained, but do not gain the praise
    lavished upon elven wizards.

    Relations: Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual
    level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another
    race, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing the race as a whole. If called on
    this behavior, the elf often doesn't understand why his "special friend" is upset the elf has noticed the friend is
    "so much better than the rest of his kind." Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch
    themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking.

    Elves are not foolish enough, however, to dismiss all aspects of other races and cultures. An elf might not want
    a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge dwarves' skill at smithing and their tenacity in
    facing orc threats. Elves regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, but regard their magical
    talent as being worthy of praise and respect. Halflings are often viewed with a measure of pity, for these small
    folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, who seem to
    live in a few short years as full a life as an elf manages in centuries. In fact, many elves become infatuated with
    humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world. Elves have difficulty accepting crossbreeds of any
    sort, however, and usually disown such offspring. They similarly regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion,
    assuming they possess the worst aspects of orc and human personalities.

    Alignment and Religion: Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic
    good, wishing all creatures to be safe and happy, but unwilling to sacrifice personal freedom or choice to
    accomplish such goals. serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking
    some base physical gratification.

    Adventurers: Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to
    reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their ancestors. This need
    to see a wider world is accepted by their societies as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced
    individuals. Such elves are expected to return in some few decades and take up lives in their homelands once more,
    enriched both in treasure and in worldview. For those elves raised among humans, however, life within their
    homes—watching friends and family swiftly age and die—is often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an
    adventurer holds a natural appeal.

    Elves generally eschew melee because of their relative frailty, preferring instead to engage enemies at range.
    Most see combat as unpleasant even when needful, and prefer it be done as quickly as possible, preferably without
    getting close enough to smell their foes. This preference for making war at a distance, coupled with their natural
    accuracy and grasp of the arcane, encourages elves to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.
